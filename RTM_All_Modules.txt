## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is maintained to ensure
all functional requirements defined in the SRS are covered by
test scenarios and test cases.

The RTM maps:
- Requirement ID → Test Scenario ID → Test Case ID
- Tracks execution status and coverage
